# 🐟 Clarias Fish Growth Prediction App

## Overview

This project provides an interactive Streamlit web app and a Jupyter notebook for predicting the **final mean weight** of *Clarias gariepinus* (African catfish) juveniles and fingerlings. The prediction is based on feed composition and growth parameters, leveraging a machine learning model trained on real experimental data.

---

## Features

- **User-friendly Streamlit app** for quick predictions
- Predicts final mean weight based on 10 key growth and feed parameters
- Interactive sliders, radio buttons, and real-time feedback
- Model trained using a robust scikit-learn pipeline
- Transparent code and reproducible workflow

---

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the **Unilorin Zoology Department Library** and is based on two undergraduate projects:

- **Adenusi Morenike Hannah (18/55EK036):**  
  *Growth performances of Clarias gariepinus juveniles fed with varying levels of Citrus sinesis peel and pulp single cell protein.*
- **Yusuf Habibat (17/55EK225):**  
  *Growth performance of Clarias fingerlings fed on single cell protein from Dioscorea rotundata peel.*
